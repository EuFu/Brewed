                Nearly 60&#37; of coffee produced globally is of species Arabica, with the remainder mainly Canephora
                (aka Robusta). Though lesser known species exist, like Liberica and Excelsa, they have been relegated to more
                niche and unique types in todays market.
                <br>
                <br>
                Arabica is usually preferred for its complex flavors and acidity, lower bitterness, and lower caffeine content
                compared to Robusta. Robusta on the other hand is hardy, resistant to disease, and has higher yields, making it
                a staple for use in instant coffee, strong coffee blends, and concentrated and sweetened brews such as
                Vietnamese coffee.
                <br>
                <br>
                Within these two main species, many varieties exist, mainly of the Arabica type, each which have their own unique
                characteristics flavor profiles.

                        Coffee is believed to have originated from Ethiopia, with thousands of varieties in existence. Not enough
                        genetic testing has been done to distinguish all these varieties, with natural cross-pollination adding
                        more complexity to documenting new varieties. Ethiopian Heirloom is an umbrella term to describe all these
                        varienties in this region.

                        to South America and further spread around the world. It is the parent to other varieties which are
                        mutations, or crossbreeds of Typica. Known for its cleaness, sweetness, mild acidity, it can be considered
                        a standard showcasing the excellent cupping quality of Arabica.

                        Gesha coffees demand some of the highest prices in the specialty coffee market. Though more demanding, difficult

                        Discovered in Costa Rica in the 1950/60s and developed in the town of Sarchi, Villa Sarchi is a natural
                        mutation of Bourbon that grows much smaller. Well adapted to very high altitudes and strong winds, the variety
                        is still capable of producing good cupping quality.

                        Much like Caturra and Villa Sarchi, Pacas is a mutation of Bourbon which causes dwarfism. Discovered by the Pacas family in
                        El Salvador in 1949, Pacas was selected for a pedigree breeding program by the Salvadoran Institute for Coffee Research (ISIC) in 1960.
                        Similar to other deviations from Bourbon, Pacas can be planted more densely, thus producing higher yields, and can thrive better
                        at higher altitudes.

                        Produced on the small island of Timor, these beans are a cross between Arabica and Robusta, and an important

                        A hybrid of Caturra and Timor, hence its name, it was developed in Portugal in the 1950's. The Robusta
                        lineage from its Timor parent gives these beans more bitterness, astringency, sourness and higher
                        concentration of caffeine than typical Arabica. It also means that Catimor grows quicker, is higher
                        producing, and more pest and rust resistant, and became a popular plant in South and Central America.
